## Optional fields

You can mark fields as optional to skip their validation if they are `undefined` or one of the values provided in an array:

```
const schema = {
  lastName: {
    minLength: 2,
    optional: true,
  },
  description: {
    minLength: 2,
    optional: ['', null],
  },
};
```

In this case `minLength` won't check `lastName` if it's `undefined`. It also won't check `description` if it's an empty string or `null`.
