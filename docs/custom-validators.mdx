## Custom validators

You can perform any sort of validation you want by using a custom validator:

```
const schema = {
  repeatPassword: {
    custom: (repeat, { data }) => {
	  if (repeat !== data.password)
	    return Promise.reject('Passwords must match');
    },
  },
};
```

The first argument passed to a validator is the value of the field that is being validated (in this case `repeatPassword`). The second argument is a context object from which you can access all of the data. To fail a check, return a rejected `Promise` and pass your error message to it.

### Multiple custom validators

To use multiple custom validators on a field, put them in an array:

```
const schema = {
  username: {
    custom: [
      username => {},
      username => {},
    ],
  },
};
```
