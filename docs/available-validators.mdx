## Available validators

- `type` - checks if the JavaScript type of a value matches the provided one. Accepts either a string or an object with the `in` property containing an array of strings.

  ```
  {
    name: {
      type: 'string',
    },
    age: {
      type: { in: ['string', 'number'] },
    },
  }
  ```

  While checking the type on the front-end is not necessary because that is something that should be handled by appropriate input types, you should always check the type on the back-end.

- `minLength` - fails if the length is lower than the provided number. Skips validation for values that are neither a string nor an array.

  ```
  {
    name: {
      minLength: 2,
    },
    items: {
      minLength: 1,
    },
  }
  ```

- `maxLength` - fails if the length is greater than the provided number. Skips validation for values that are neither a string nor an array.

  ```
  {
    name: {
      maxLength: 20,
    },
    items: {
      maxLength: 5,
    },
  }
  ```

- `pattern` - tests a string against the provided regular expression. Skips validation for values that are not a string.

  ```
  {
    password: {
      pattern: [/\d/, 'Must include a digit'],
    },
  }
  ```

- `isArray` - fails if the value is or isn't an array depending on the provided boolean constraint.

  ```
  {
    items: {
      isArray: true,
    },
  }
  ```

- `min` - fails if a number is lower than the provided one. Skips validation for values that are not a number.

  ```
  {
    age: {
      min: 15,
    },
  }
  ```

- `max` - fails if a number is greater than the provided one. Skips validation for values that are not a number.

  ```
  {
    age: {
      max: 18,
    },
  }
  ```
